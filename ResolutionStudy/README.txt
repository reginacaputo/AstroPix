This study aims to define the ideal pixel size for the AstroPix project.

The basic geopmetry is composed of
    - 50 layers (1mx1m) of voxel detectors
    - ideal calorimeter
    - (passive material on top of each tkr layer)
    
We want to build a routine to build and test different geometries changing some parameters:
   - Voxel size:
		* 10 mm
		* 5 mm
		* 3 mm
		* 1 mm
		* 0.5 mm
		* ... (enough to see the plateau)
   - Si thickness:
		* 300 um
		* 500 um
		* 700 um 
   - passive material:
		* 1%
   		* 2%
		* 5%
		* 10%

We want to test the different configurations for different energies:
   	   	* 100 keV
		* 662 keV
		* 1000 keV
